## Maha Fluid Power Research Center

Welcome!  This is the GitHub profile of the Maha Fluid Power Research Center at Purdue University.

### :information_source: About
As the largest academic hydraulics and fluid power research lab in the United States, the Maha Fluid Power Research Center is recognized as a leader in innovative methods to research and apply fluid power technology. We conduct research on existing technical challenges, explore new application fields, and promote industrial collaborations.

Our researchers bring their expertise to all aspects of fluid power – from computer modeling to real-world experimentation – and apply that knowledge to hydraulic components and overall actuation systems. With faculty from the Colleges of Engineering and Agriculture, we provide solutions in the several areas of fluid power, including solutions for high efficiency, low noise emissions, superior controllability, integration of fluid power and electric technology.
